            <h1> Who am I?</h1>
            <p> My name is Aadhar Sharma, I am a senior at UCSD majoring in Computer Engineering. 
                I live in Fremont, California with my parents and younger brother. 
                An interesting fact about me is that I have had plently of international exposure as a child. 
                My dad moved a lot throughout my childhood due to work, and he took the family along.
                I was originally born in India, then at the age of three I moved to Malyasia. 
                In Malaysia, I lived in three different cities from 2003 to 2006. Johor, Kuala Rampur, and Penang.
                I do not remeber much from Malyasia since I was quite young at the time, but I do remember learning
                some Malya (the native language). After Malaysia, at the age of six, my family moved to Shenzhen, China.
                China is where I spent the bulk of my pre-teen years, and during this time I also go pretty fluent in Mandarin.
                I live in Shenzhen for five years then we moved to Shanghai, where I stayed for one year.
                This whole time, I was going to an international school, so the curriculum was similar to American schools.
                Finally, at the age of 12 in 2013, we moved to Fremont, California, and have been living here ever since. 
                All this interantional exposure at a young age has trained me to be able to adapt easily in any environment.
