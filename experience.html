            <h1> System Validation Engineer Intern </h1>
            <p>
                Although I worked with the System Design Verification Team (DVT), my work during the internship was more software oriented. 
                My project involved in developing a tool that would make life easier for the engineers in my team. 
                The Verification Team has a very important job of running tests on the SSDs to make sure they are functioning properly. 
                In order to run these tests, a tool called Oakgate is used which parses through different xml files, getting parameters for specific tests. 
                My project was to create a GUI that would allow the engineers to input a directory that contains multiple xml files and then upon clicking enter, an excel sheet should be generated. 
                The excel sheet contained all the different test names, variations, and parameters for all the xml files in the directory that was inputted. 
                This excel file was useful because now the engineers could view multiple xml files at once in a clean manner. 
                In addition to this, if they made any changes in the excel sheet, they could update the corresponding xml file. 
                This could be done by choosing the option to update xml files in the GUI and entering the directory to all the xml files once again. 
                I developed he backend of the GUI that using Python. Some important libraries that I used were: os, tkinter, xml, xlsxwriter. 
                There were many other libraries used, but these were the main ones. 
                This tool was made to help Design Verification and optimize Solid State Drive (SSD) testing. 
                At the end of the internship, I had to build a powerpoint and present my project to the Design Verification Team.
